# Simple commands (Week 1/2)

- Play around with the following commands just to get a feel for the command prompt, what error messages look like, etc.
- Keep notes on anything that you find surprising or that you don't understand.

**Useful operators, commands, and concepts for this unit...**

``pi``, ``( )``, ``[ ]`` ``:``, ``whos``, ``size()``, ``rand()``, ``mean()``, ``std()``, ``min()``, ``max()``, ``rem()`` (remainder after division), ``reshape()``, ``repmat()``, indexing, rows, columns

1. Make sure to ``clear all`` before starting on these exercises. Keep some notes on what's going on and try to understand each step and then move on to the next section
  ```matlab
  a = [3, pi, 10, 1; 2 7 4 1]
  b = 20:3:30
  c = 2
  ```

2. Is the following allowed (correct syntactically)? Why?:
  ```matlab
  a .* c
  a .* b
  b .* c
  d = a .* c
  ```

3. Given the variables ``a, b, c, d``, what about the following. Some of these are quite subtle, so make sure you understand:
  ```matlab
  % indexing into a
  a(:,2)
  a(1,4)
  a(1)
  a(2)
  a(9)
  a(4,4)
  a(4,4) = 1.2
  a
  % ... and b
  b(3,1)
  b(1,3)
  ```

4. Moving on to slightly larger vectors and matrices:
  ```matlab
  % spot the difference here:
  e = rand(100,1)
  e = rand(100,1);
  % now that we have this:
  mean(e)
  ```
  ... and now for matrices:
  ```matlab
  a
  mean(a)
  mean(a,1)
  mean(a,2)
  help mean
  ```

5. Other useful functions that "collapse across dimensions":
  ```matlab
  median(e)
  std(e)
  max(e)
  min(e)
  ```
  ... and we can also keep track of where the min/max occurred:
  ```matlab
  [minValue minIndex] = min(e)
  e(minIndex)
  ```

6. ... and some others that are useful with dealing with indices, counting, etc.:
  ```matlab
  f = 1:100
  rem(f,2) % remainder after division w/ 2
  ```
  Not standard Matlab, but very useful helper functions from @justingardner
  ```matlab
  isodd(f)
  iseven(f)
  ```

7. See how you can turn 1..N into a repeating pattern:
  ```matlab
  rem(f,3) + 1
  rem(f+2,3) + 1
  ```

8. Turn a vector into a matrix by ``reshape()``:
  ```matlab
  size(f)
  reshape(f,[10 10])
  reshape(f,[2 50])
  reshape(f,[2 40])
  ```

9. Creating bigger vectors and matrices from smaller ones by tiling: ``repmat()``:
  ```matlab
  repmat([1 2 3], 1, 5)
  repmat([1 2 3], 5, 1)
  ```
